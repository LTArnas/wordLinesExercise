Exercise description:

Given an abritrary list of words and a line length, 
join the words together to form lines of the specified length. 
The last line and any lines containing only a single word may end with one or more spaces 
(however many are needed to meet the required line length). 
All others lines must begin and end with a word. 
Spacing of roughly equal length should be placed between the words, 
with the larger spaces occuring at the beginning of the line. 
In the last line, words should be separated by a single space, 
with the remaning space (if any) to the right of the last word of that line.
